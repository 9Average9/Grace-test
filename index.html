      <h4>
        The Spiritual gifts are designed to be used in and for the body of Christ, particularly in the local
church. Every believer has at least one spiritual gift that is given to them at the time of salvation by
the Holy Spirit. While we should all use our spiritual gifts for the sake of the body, we should also
strive to teach and train others to use our gifts as well. For example, if you have the gift of
discernment, you should teach and train others to use this gift as well since we are called as believers
to use discernment (Phil. 1:9; Heb. 4:12). We do not believe that the sign gifts are in operation today
and ceased with the completion of the cannon.
      </h4>
      
     
        <h6>Administration </h6> <h4>

business matters of the church
Other Ministry: presiding at meetings as chairperson, organizing outreaches, coordinator of a variety of

      </h4>

<h4>
Definition: to voluntarily remain single without regret and with the ability to maintain controlled sexual

useful in areas with high ministry demands on time and in areas requiring much time away from home.
Observations About This Gifting: • The word for “gift” in 1 Corinthians 7:7, 8 is ‘charisma,’ the same as
the word for ‘spiritual gift.’ • This gift must be used along with other gifts AND MINISTRY as there is no
merit in being gifted this way if that is all there is to it. The purpose of being gifted in celibacy would be
to allow you to be more effective in ministry.

        in designing or implementing solutions. They may be correct in their perceptions but ineffective in their
        approach, unless accompanied by wisdom and grace. • People with this gift may need to work through
        self-righteousness and defensiveness which it can easily breed. • There needs to be an understanding of
        the difference between judging to condemn and judging to correct with mercy and truth.</h4>

Observations About This Gifting: • People with the gift of evangelism should caution against: 1) pride in
number of converts, using it as a sign of spirituality, 2) failure to learn and grow in other areas, 3) seeing
people as numbers rather than people with needs</h4>

      
        <h6>Exhortation/Encouragement </h6>

        Speaking/Teaching Ministry: exhortations, sermonettes, sermons, teaching, training
        Staff-Support Ministry: encouragement
        Worship Ministry: through singing, testimonies
        Observations About This Gifting: • People with this gift tend to be process-oriented, not goal-oriented. •
        People with the gift of exhortation must take caution against: 1) pride in their motivational ability, 2)
        becoming overloaded with too many people demands • Someone with this gift may not become
        involved in long-term commitment as would a pastor but becomes concerned with the spiritual welfare
        of a brother or sister for the period of time it takes to help that person and then moves on to another
        person in need (meets a particular need of a particular person at a particular time).</h4>

        Visionary Ministry: long-range planning team, participate in special projects, new ministry initiatives
        where there are significant obstacles to be overcome and the reality of spiritual warfare is keenly felt
        Observations About This Gifting: • Common traits are optimism, perseverance, tendency to be future
        and change-oriented. • Someone with the gift of faith will tend to be bored without a challenge and
        should therefore avoid only being in ministries having to maintain status quo.</h4>

        Benevolence Ministry: give directly to people in need or to organizations that reach out to people in
        need like hunger and relief agencies
        Worship Ministry: all giving should be seen as an act of worship
        Other Ministry: direct missionary support; provide care, lodging or other resources for missionaries
        home on furlough; scholarship for students training for ministry; sponsor or underwrite special projects
        
        Observations About This Gifting: • A person with this gift tends to display resourcefulness, generosity,
        and caring. • If people with this gift don’t have the material resources to meet a need, they will be
        motivated to pray and see needs are met otherwise. • People with the gift of giving must take caution
        against: 1) a critical attitude of those unable to give, 2) control with one’s money</h4>


       
        <h6>Helps </h6>
        <h4>
        Definition: to render support or assistance to others in the body so as to free them up for ministry
        Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:28
        Greek Word: antilepsis - laying hold of, to be a partaker of; relief, partake, support
        Scriptural Role Models to Study: Epaphroditus (Philemon 2:25-30)
        Characteristics of Someone with this Gift:
        ___ others know they can call upon this person to assist them
        ___ feels more comfortable helping someone behind the scenes to get prepared than to do the actual
        teaching or leading
        ___ eager to relieve others of routine tasks so they can move on to more essential areas of their
        ministry
        ___ enjoys helping others get their work done
        ___ genuinely glad to assist others
        Ministry Areas &amp; Tasks Using This Gift:
        Train others in the body to use this gift.
        Clerical Ministry: bulletin, computer, finances, letter writing, office work, record keeping, secretary
        Communications Ministry: editing, newsletter, publicity, sound system, power points
        Service-Oriented Ministry: deacon/deaconess, variety of tasks that assist others to get their work done
        Staff-Support Ministry: assistant, clerical, implementation, maintain resources &amp; supplies, office work,
        research, teacher’s helper
        Observations About This Gifting: • By not carrying the weight of decision-making, people with the gift of
        helps are free to help others get the job done. • A person with the gift of helps will tend to display a
        servant attitude, loyalty, attention to detail, and responsiveness to the initiative of others. People with
        the gift of helps must take caution against 1) getting trapped in the responsibility of leading the ministry
        themselves. (If they do, they will tend to miss the big picture and will feel frustrated if specific jobs are
        not done well.), 2) tendency to put needs of others before those of their own family, 3) feelings of
        insignificance • Unlike the gift of mercy, the recipients of those exercising the gift of helps are not
        people who are down and out but other Christians exercising their gifts. • The gift of helps is more
        people-oriented while the gift of service is more task-oriented. (Focus is on people more than the
        project.)</h4>


      
        <h6>Knowledge </h6>
        <h4>
        Definition: to seek to learn as much about the Bible as possible through the gathering of much
        information and the analyzing of that data

        science, knowledge

        Characteristics of Someone with this Gift:
        ___ known as a scholar of the Bible
        ___ enjoys searching for answers to difficult questions in God&#39;s Word
        ___ able to take information from several sources and come up with an answer or a thesis about a
        subject
        ___ takes great joy in discovering Bible truths on one’s own
        Ministry Areas &amp; Tasks Using This Gift:
        Train others in the body to use this gift.
        Speaking/Teaching Ministry: preparation for speaking or teaching, writing
        Staff-Support Ministry: research
        Other Ministry: prepare plan or presentation for a ministry vision or project
        Observations About This Gifting: • There are those who would define the gift of knowledge as having
        some extra-biblical revelation. There is no extra-biblical revelation outside of the bible. • People with
        the gift of knowledge tend to display analytical ability and objective thinking. • People with the gift of
        knowledge ought to avoid carrying the primary responsibility to lead or implement the plan they have
        helped to devise unless accompanied by other gifting. • Those with the gift of knowledge and not of
        teaching may be boring. Few people can learn from them. They have good material but it is hard to stay
        with them.</h4>


     
        <h6>Leadership </h6>
         <h4>
        Definition: to stand before the people in such a way as to attend to the direction of the body with such
        care and diligence so as to motivate others to get involved in the accomplishment of these goals
        Scripture: Romans 12:8
        Greek Word: proistemi - to stand before, to preside, be over (literally the one who stands upfront)
        Scriptural Role Models to Study: James (Acts 15)
        Characteristics of Someone with this Gift:
        ___ people respect and follow this person’s direction
        
        ___ good at setting goals and seeing the direction the body should take
        ___ able to guide and motivate people to join in the achievement of one’s goals
        ___ if in a group where there is no leader, will assume leadership
        ___ a goal-setter
        Ministry Areas &amp; Tasks Using This Gift:
        Train others in the body to use this gift.
        Christian Education Ministry: goal-setter of any variety of Christian education ministries
        Visionary Ministry: pastor, elder, leader of a variety of target groups, overseer, steering committee
        Observations About This Gifting: • The distinction between the gift of administration and leadership
        must be made. Two different Greek words are used. Administration (kubernesis) means to steer or
        guide as a helmsman. An administrator works more on the accomplishment of goals whereas a leader is
        the one who is more a goal-setter. • A person with the gift of leadership should avoid being placed in a
        position that requires devotion to details and implementation of particulars. • There needs to be an
        understanding on the limits of a spiritual leader’s authority. Gifted leaders do not manipulate or coerce
        (Mk. 10:42-45). Rather, because they know where they are going, they generate a confidence.</h4>

        
          <h6>Mercy/Compassion </h6>
          <h4>
          Definition: to be sensitive toward those who are suffering, whether physically, mentally, or emotionally,
          so as to feel genuine sympathy with their misery, speaking words of compassion but more caring for
          them with deeds of love to help alleviate their distress
          Scripture: Romans 12:8
          Greek Word: eleeo - have (obtain, receive, show) compassion
          Scriptural Role Models to Study: Good Samaritan (Luke 10)
          Characteristics of Someone with this Gift:
          ___ has a tender heart toward the needy and will often do what one can to help those who are in
          distress
          ___ enjoys visiting the sick and shut-in
          ___ looks out for those who are neglected and alienated
          ___ empathizes with those who are embarrassed and humiliated and seeks to comfort them
          ___ likes to spend time with those who are lonely and hurting to cheer them up
          Ministry Areas &amp; Tasks Using This Gift:
          Train others in the body to use this gift.
          
          Benevolence Ministry: cards/flowers, child-care, emergency shelter, food/clothes distribution, financial
          assistance, hospital &amp; shut-in visitation, special needs, transportation
          Other Targeted Ministry: ministry to the elderly, disabled, prisoners, poor, sick
          Observations About This Gifting: • The focus of mercy is more on caring than counseling. • People with
          the gift of mercy tend to be seen as perceptive, consoling, and nonjudgmental. • People with the gift of
          mercy may have difficulty in evaluating the intentions of others and may experience the pain of being
          used. • There needs to be an understanding of the balance between God’s mercy and justice. •
          Exposure to those with the gift of exhortation and discernment would be helpful.
        </h4>
        
         <h6>Missions </h6>
         <h4>
Definition: to be able to minister in another culture
Scripture: Ephesians 3:6-8
Scriptural Role Models to Study: Paul (Acts 9-28 - see 9:15; Ephesians 3:6-8)
Characteristics of Someone with this Gift:
___ enjoys the challenge of living and working in another culture
___ able to easily and quickly adapt to the customs and lifestyles of another land
___ able to learn foreign languages without too much difficulty
___ appreciates and desires to minister to people different from oneself
Ministry Areas &amp; Tasks Using This Gift:
Train others in the body to use this gift.
Outreach Ministry: foreign missions, inner-city work, short-term missions
Observations About This Gifting: Those with the gift of missionary will undoubtedly have other spiritual
gifts which they will be able to use comfortably in another culture. • Some evangelists have the gift of
missionary but some don’t. Those who do should consider evangelizing in another culture but those who
don’t are often better witnessing on the home front.
        </h4>
        
          <h6>Pastoring </h6>
          <h4>
Definition: to be responsible for spiritually caring for, protecting, guiding, and feeding a group of

Staff-Support Ministry: oversee staff
Other Ministry: director of any target group, dean of a Bible college, Sunday School teacher who gets
involved in students’ lives outside of the classroom
Observations About This Gifting: • A distinction needs to be made between the office of pastor and
someone with the gift of pastor. Both male and female can have the gift of pastoring while the office of
pastor is only for men. Not all who fill the office of pastor have this gift. • People with the gift of pastor
in the office of pastor will be limited in time to deal with the overall picture, vision, goals and growth
principles because they are so involved in the nitty-gritty’s of peoples’ lives.
        </h4>
       
          <h6>Service </h6>
           <h4>

Observations About This Gifting: • Service is not a one-on-one person-centered gift like the gifts of
mercy and helps. It is more task-oriented. • The gift of service is often used with other natural skills such
as carpentry, photography, printing, etc. • People with the gift of service must be careful not to: 1)
isolate themselves excessively from relationships with others in lieu of behind-the-scenes work, 2) not
receive from others as well as give 3) not be able to say no to all the physical needs around them
        </h4>
        
          <h6>Teaching </h6>
          <h4>
Definition: to instruct others in the Bible in a logical, systematic way so as to communicate pertinent
information for true understanding and growth
Scripture: Romans 12:7; 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11
